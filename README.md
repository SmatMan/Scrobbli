# Scrobbli

## Scrobbli is a ReactJS Web App that interacts with the LastFM API, allowing you to sort a user's top scrobbles in a specified time period.

### Documentation is (might be) coming soon (depends on how many people want it)

## If you'd like to fork this project or use some of the code in your own project, attribution is REQUIRED. A link to my Github is sufficient.
