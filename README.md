# Scrobbli

## Scrobbli is a ReactJS Web App that interacts with the LastFM API, allowing you to sort a user's top scrobbles in a specified time period.

### Documentation is (might be) coming soon (depends on how many people want it)

## If you'd like to fork this project or use some of the code in your own project, attribution is REQUIRED. A link to my Github is sufficient.

# Installation and Setup

1. Make sure to add your Last.FM API key to config.example.js (get one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)). After you've done that, just rename config.example.js to config.js!
2. Install all the Node modules using npm/yarn specified in package.json
3. Run the code by going to the root directory of this project and run `npm start`. You can now go to `http://localhost:3000` on your PC, or your host's private IP address with the port 3000
4. You should be all set!
